    """
    When keywording or stabilizing a package, find the dependencies that also
    need to be keyworded or stabilized.  All packages in the returned result
    will contain the full version specification (PVR).

    The 'target_keyword' parameter is used to specify not only the architecture
    on which the keywording or stabilization will happen but also whether the
    processing is for keywording or stabilization.  For instance, specifying
    '~amd64' as the argument for this parameter indicates that keywording is
    being performed on the amd64 architecture, whereas specifying 'amd64'
    indicates that stabilization is being done on amd64.

    'pkg_filter' can be used to restrict versions of dependencies that may be
    selected based on any attribute supported by the
    pkgcore.ebuild.ebuild_src.package class.  If the argument for this
    parameter is not omitted and is not 'None', then this function will apply
    the specified filter on every dependency when it searches for the version
    of that dependency to be included in the returned result.  If no version
    passes through the filter, then this function will search for a version of
    the dependency again without the filter.

    'pkg_filter' is never applied to 'main_package'; it is in effect only in
    dependency version selection.

    'pkg_filter' examples:
    - lambda pkgs: filter(lambda pkg: '~amd64' in pkg.keywords, pkgs)
        For each dependency, use the best version among all versions that are
        keyworded on amd64 whenever it is available.
    - lambda pkgs: filter(lambda pkg: 'amd64' in pkg.keywords, pkgs)
        For each dependency, use the best version among all versions that are
        stable on amd64 whenever it is available.

    Invocation examples:
    - To keyword dev-java/ant-core and its dependencies on riscv and avoid
      keywording dependencies that have not been stabilized on amd64 yet:
        atom = get_atom_obj_from_str('dev-java/ant-core')
        _, repo = nattka.package.find_repository(Path('/var/db/repos/gentoo'))

        )
        # Keyword packages listed in 'packages_to_process'

    :param main_package: the main package to keyword or stabilize
    :param target_keyword: the keyword that would be added to the main
        package's 'KEYWORDS' variable after the process
    :param repo: the object representing the ebuild repository where candidate
